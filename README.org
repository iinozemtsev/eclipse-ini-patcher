This small maven plugin contains two enhancements for Eclipse RCP builds for Mac OS X:
- Updates =Info.plist= file to add Retina support
- Adds missing "-startup" parameter in =eclipse.ini= file during publishing product using p2. As a result, some important p2 operations, such as updates, fail in resulting RCPs.

The plugin itslef provide a single goal 'patch-ini-file' and has no configuration at all - instead it relies on configuration of =org.sonatype.tycho:tycho-p2-director-plugin=.

To use it, modify your pom so that 'patch-ini-file' goal is executed between =materialize-products= and =publish-products= goals of of =tycho-p2-director-plugin=.

#+END_SRC
Here the *materialize-products* goal is moved to *verify* stage (instead of *package* stage by default) so that I can insert my goal before it. However probably there's another way to specify the desired execution order.
